The following are some quick notes on how to test the original "orch" project.

Get the project:
$ git clone https://github.com/alexlarsson/orch

The following code change is required:
orch/node.c
-----------
job_isolate()
    if (r >= 0)
        r = sd_bus_message_append(m, "ss", isolate->target, "replace"); // Change "isolate" to "replace"

Build the project:
$ cd orch
$ make all

The orchestrator, running on the primary node, listens on TCP port 1999, so
configure the firewalld to accept traffic on that port:
$ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=1999/tcp
$ sudo firewall-cmd --list-all

Run the orchestrator on the primary node:
$ ./orch

Check that the primary node is listening on TCP port 1999:
$ netstat -tlnp | grep 1999

Start orch-node on a remote node:
$ sudo ./orch-node <orch_ip_addr> <node_name>

where orch_ip_addr is the IP address of the primary node.

Run orch-client on the primary node to access systemd services on the remote
node via the orchestrator:
$ ./orch-client isolate-all <unit_name>

where unit_name is the name of a systemd service on the remote node.

Example:
$ ./orch-client isolate-all crond.service

The orch-node session on the remote node will show something like the following:

$ sudo ./orch-node 192.168.1.51 some_node
Registered as 'some_node'
Removed Job /org/freedesktop/systemd1/job/3435 session-7.scope done
Removed Job /org/freedesktop/systemd1/job/3545 systemd-hostnamed.service done
Got Isolate 'crond.service'
Queued job 1
Started job 1
Running job 1, Isolate crond.service
job_isolate_request_cb
got job_path /org/freedesktop/systemd1/job/3652
Removed Job /org/freedesktop/systemd1/job/3652 crond.service done
job_isolate_request_done, result: done
Finished job 1, result: done

NOTE:
If you want to run orch-node as a non-priviledged user, add a polkit rule to
allow your user's access to systemd services as follows:
/etc/polkit-1/rules.d/service-auth.rules
----------------------------------------
polkit.addRule(function(action, subject) {
    if (action.id == "org.freedesktop.systemd1.manage-units" &&
        subject.user == "sdunnaga") {
        return polkit.Result.YES;
    } });
