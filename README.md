# Hirte

Hirte is a service orchestrator tool intended for multi-node devices (e.g.: edge devices) clusters
with a predefined number of nodes and with a focus on highly regulated environment such as those requiring functional
safety (for example in cars).

Hirte is relying on [systemd](https://github.com/systemd/systemd) and its D-Bus API, which
it extends for multi-node use case.

Hirte can also be used to orchestrate containers using [podman](https://github.com/containers/podman/) and its ability
to generate systemd service configuration to run a container.
