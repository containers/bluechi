Thank you for your interest in Eclipse BlueChi.

## Project description

[Eclipse BlueChi](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/automotive.bluechi) is a deterministic multi-node service
controller with a focus on highly regulated ecosystems. It is written in C and integrates seamless with
systemd via its D-Bus API relaying D-Bus messages over TCP for multi-node
support. BlueChi is built around three components:

- bluechi-controller
- bluechi-agent
- bluechictl

## Testing

```bash
dnf copr enable @centos-automotive-sig/bluechi-snapshot
```
